# Celestial Bodies User Stories

## User Story 1: Hobbyist
* As a stargazing hobbyist, Celestial Bodies is a helpful app for knowing what's above me at any given time so I can watch them at night.
The app also displays how far away the object is and other cool facts about it. It's an invaluable for hobbyists like me.

## User Story 2: Astronomy Professor
* As a college astronomy professor I want an app that identifies stars and constellations in real time and then documents the date and time that the constellation or star was located by a student.

## User Story 3: Amateur Astronomer
* As an astronomy hobbyist I want an app that allows me and my hobbyist friends to easily locate stars, constellations, galaxies, etc. that we want to look at so that we can more easily aim our telescopes.  I want to be able to connect with my hobbyist circle as well as find other hobbyists in the area and around the country using the same app.

## User Story 4: Parent
* As a parent I want an app that my child will want to use to get interested in getting outside and understanding something about the solar system and the stars and other things going on out there like satellites.  I would like the app to allow my child to take a snap shot of the part of the sky he was looking at, with the identity of the star or planet he was looking at and be able to send that shot and information to his friends.

## User Story 5: Star Club Member:
* Celestial Bodies is such reliable app, we use it for our Star Club! All the members are we able to easily download the app and now we all have access to the same information. The president of club is able to tell us what area of the sky to look at for the celestial body of the week and we are all able to follow along.
